# rozmitmat

Version: 0.1.0

This is a Rust implementation of an ARP spoofing attack.
Currently this is a work in progress; the main functionality of the program is working fine though.

Rozmitmat is a vision of a hacking tool I am developing for a knowledge gathering about how network and Linux/Windows systems work.

The work is based on the (https://github.com/gcarq/arp-spoof) repository.
